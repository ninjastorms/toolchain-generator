ninjastorms toolchain generator
===============================

This project provides a generator for cross compile toolchains for ninjastorms
compilation. The toolchains include binutils, gcc and optionally gdb for
debugging.

Example Invocation:
  $> TARGET=i686-elf ./toolchain-generator.sh

Influential environment variables:
----------------------------------

The generated toolchain and the build process can be altered using by setting
the following variables in the environment:

  TARGET
    configure the target triplet for the generated toolchain. Common examples
    are: arm-none-eabi, i686-elf, x86_64-elf. Defaults to arm-none-eabi.

  PREFIX
    configure the install prefix of the generated toolchain. Defaults to
    `/usr/local`.

  MFLAGS
    define additional flags to pass to `make` invocations, for example to
    parallelize the builds.


  BINUTILS_VERSION
    the version of binutils to use. Defaults to 2.24

  GCC_VERSION
    the version of gcc to use. Defaults to 4.8.0

  GMP_VERSION
    the version of gmp to use. Defaults to 5.1.1

  MPC_VERSION
    the version of mpc to use. Defaults to 1.0.1

  MPFR_VERSION
    the version of mpfr to use. Defaults to 3.1.2

  GDB_VERSION
    the version of gdb to use. Set empty to exclude gdb from the generated
    toolchain. Defaults to 7.6


  TARDIR
    configure the target directory for downloaded tarballs. Should probably
    be left unchanged. Defaults to `sources/`.

  BUILDROOT
    configure the target directory for builds. Defaults to `/tmp`.
